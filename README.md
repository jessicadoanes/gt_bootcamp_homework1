### Analysis Questions
Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns? 
Conclusion 1: The most successful kickstarter campaigns are created by creators in theater (839), music (540), and film & video (300), respectively. 
Conclusion 2: Journalism is the most difficult category to have a kickstarter campaign.

#### What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset does not include a Legend explaining the headers. (i.e., spotlight, staff pick)
The Kickstarter blurb does not provide adequate. For example, was the Kickstarter created to grow/scale up a product that already existed, such as web series on YouTube becoming a TV series. 
The dataset does not contain number of views, click, and redirects from social media and email campaigns, so we cannot identify how many people were informed versus those who backed the Kickstarter. 

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 
Number of views, click, and redirects from social media and email campaigns versus Goal, Backers count
Country by country with filters for parent and subcategory
